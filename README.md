# Text-Summarizer


## Overview

This Python-based text summarizer is designed to condense lengthy documents or articles into shorter, coherent summaries. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to extract key information and generate concise summaries while preserving the essential content.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarizer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd text-summarizer
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Run the summarizer using the command line interface:

```bash
python summarizer.py --input_file <input_file_path> --output_file <output_file_path> --length <summary_length>
```

- `<input_file_path>`: Path to the input text file you want to summarize.
- `<output_file_path>`: Path to save the generated summary.
- `<summary_length>`: Optional parameter to specify the desired length of the summary (default is 5 sentences).

### Example

```bash
python summarizer.py --input_file sample.txt --output_file summary.txt --length 3
```

This command will read the content from `sample.txt`, generate a summary of 3 sentences, and save it to `summary.txt`.

### Python Interface

You can also use the summarizer in your Python scripts:

```python
from summarizer import summarize_text

input_text = "Your input text here..."
summary = summarize_text(input_text, length=5)  # Adjust length as needed
print(summary)
```
